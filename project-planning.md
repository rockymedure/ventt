# Ventt - Job Loss Support Platform
## Project Planning & Strategic Questions

### Project Vision
A mobile-first website where people who recently lost their jobs can vent frustrations about job searching difficulties and connect with others who've experienced similar challenges or found success.

### Core User Needs
1. **Immediate emotional relief** - Need to vent frustrations right away
2. **Community connection** - Feel less alone in the struggle  
3. **Practical support** - Learn from others' experiences and successes
4. **Hope and motivation** - See that others have found their way through

## Strategic Questions to Address

### 1. User Experience & Access Flow
- Should users be able to post/vent completely anonymously without any signup?
- How do we balance immediate access with building a sustainable community?
- What's the journey from "frustrated visitor" to "engaged community member"?
- What should the homepage experience be like for first-time visitors?

### 2. Community Features & Structure
- Anonymous venting posts vs. identified community discussions?
- How do we connect people with similar backgrounds/industries?
- Should we have separate spaces for different stages (recently laid off, actively searching, recently hired)?
- What community guidelines and culture do we want to establish?

### 3. Mental Health & Well-being Considerations
- How do we ensure the platform stays supportive rather than becoming a spiral of negativity?
- What safeguards and resources should we build in?
- How do we moderate content while maintaining authenticity?
- Should we integrate professional mental health resources?

### 4. Success Stories & Mentorship
- How do we keep recently hired people engaged to help others?
- What incentives/structure for peer mentorship?
- How do we showcase success stories without making struggling users feel worse?
- What's the graduation/transition process when someone finds a job?

### 5. Privacy & Safety
- What level of anonymity should we support?
- How do we handle user safety and harassment?
- What data do we collect and how do we protect it?
- How do we verify users while maintaining privacy?
