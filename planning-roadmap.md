## Decision Framework

For each planning session, we'll:
1. **Research** existing solutions and best practices
2. **Brainstorm** multiple approaches to each challenge
3. **Evaluate** options against user needs and technical constraints
4. **Decide** on specific implementations
5. **Document** decisions and rationale
6. **Validate** with potential user scenarios
